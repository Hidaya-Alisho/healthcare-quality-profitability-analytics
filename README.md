# Healthcare Quality & Profitability Analytics

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between CMS hospital quality scores and financial performance across rural and urban hospitals in the United States. The objective is to understand whether quality ratings correlate with profitability and to identify operational, regional, and hospital-type patterns that influence performance.

## Business Questions
- Do CMS quality scores correlate with hospital profitability?
- Does profit tend to increase or decrease with higher CMS scores?
- How does performance vary by state, hospital type (rural vs urban), and specialty?
- What operational patterns distinguish high-performing hospitals?

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Predictive modeling and segmentation
- Business insight generation
